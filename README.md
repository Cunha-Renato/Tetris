# Tetris
A little personal project recreating the game Tetris using java. Trying my best to use OOP correctly in this project although might be inefficient and unnecessary,
it's a good way for me to learn more about OOP.

The exe file that is included is the raw one, so you will need all the pngs(in the same folder as the exe) and java instaled.
